## Projects

- **Database management system:** I developed a system for the management of all the data and the administration of a biotechnology center, in which trades and reports can be generated automatically, as well as consultation of the database. The system works within the laboratory's internal network, so it can be accessed from different computers. For the development, JFrameForm, JInternalFrame Form, and components for the design of the graphical interface were used.

   **What i used:** MySQL and Java

 - **[Tic-Tac-Toe using minimax algorithm](https://github.com/mandorc/Tic-Tac-Toe-Project):** Proposal for the famous tic-tac-toe game where the user can choose whether to play against another person or against the system through a graphical interface. The movements that the system chooses are through the **minimax algorithm**.

   **Language:** Java

 - **[Detection of mask use](#):** Mask use detection by training a learning model in Python to detect whether or not a person is wearing a mask. For data training, an image dataset was obtained with faces with face masks and another with faces without face masks. The program was executed on a device with RISC-V architecture.

   **Language:** Python

- **[Mobile application design for the UDLAP university](https://github.com/mandorc/UI-Design-Project):** Using the Figma application, I developed the design of a design proposal for the improvement of the application aimed at UDLAP students.
